Analysis

Summary

My solution is to make a Black Jack computer game that also teaches the player how to count cards as well as gives them the opportunity to play the game. The user will be able to choose the level of the help they get from the game ranging from a card counter display with suggested moves to no support at all.

Objective

This is the list of objectives I have made to help me solve this solution; the list outlines all the features I need to meet the client’s requirements.

Proposed Solution

When making this project I will utilise the Pyglet library for Python to build the UI. I have chosen this library as there are no external dependencies meaning the game will be more portable and lightweight, there’s extensive input control allowing the user to use a console controller as well as a mouse and keyboard, and finally due to its open source BSD license it can be used for commercial projects with minimal restriction.

This projected will be entirely coded in Python utilising the Microsoft Visual Studio Code IDE and GitHub’s repositories to allow me to work from multiple devices with little restriction also acting as a free to use cloud storage service. I will additionally be using the following libraries to complete my project:
